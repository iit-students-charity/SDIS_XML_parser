        Within this Character Data block I can
        use double dashes as much as I want (along with <, &, ', and \")
        *and* %MyParamEntity; will be expanded to the text
        "Has been expanded" ... however, I can't use
        the CEND sequence. If I need to use CEND I must escape one of the
        brackets or the greater-than sign using concatenated CDATA sections.
